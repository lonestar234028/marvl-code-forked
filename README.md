# marvl-code [WIP]

This is the implementation of the approaches described in the paper:

> Fangyu Liu*, Emanuele Bugliarello*, Edoardo M. Ponti, Siva Reddy, Nigel Collier and Desmond Elliott. [Visually Grounded Reasoning over Languages and Cultures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13238). In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), Nov 2021.

We provide the pretrained models and the code for reproducing our results.

The textual data and the preprocessed visual features are available in [marvl-data](https://github.com/marvl-challenge/marvl-data).

The code will also be integrated into [VOLTA](https://github.com/e-bug/volta), upon which our repository was origally built.
